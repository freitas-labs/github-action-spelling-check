Whenever I'm starting to work on a new (side) project, I end up facing myself at creating a new GitHub organization to work on it.

But why is this the case? I've sat down and compiled a list of reasons for why creating a new org makes sense:

- You will need to create multiple repositories for different codebases
- You want to segregate development areas across multiple repositories (e.g., backend, frontend, infrastructure, business, documentation)
- You want to use the organization GitHub profile as the frontpage of your project
- Multiple people are working on the same project
- The project you're working on will eventually become a viable product, so you want to brand it
- You want to market your product as built by an entity (your organization) and not by yourself
- You want a cool little square logo in your GitHub profile (swag) ðŸ˜Ž

(this list may be updated from time to time whenever I discover more reasons)
