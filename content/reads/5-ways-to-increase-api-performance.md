1. **Pagination**
This is a common optimization when the size of the result is large. The results are streaming back to the client to improve the service responsiveness.

2. **Asynchronous Logging**
Synchronous logging deals with the disk for every call and can slow down the system. Asynchronous logging sends logs to a lock-free buffer first and immediately returns. The logs will be flushed to the disk periodically. This significantly reduces the I/O overhead.

3. **Caching**
We can cache frequently accessed data into a cache. The client can query the cache first instead of visiting the database directly. If there is a cache miss, the client can query from the database. Caches like Redis store data in memory, so the data access is much faster than the database.

4. **Payload Compression**
The requests and responses can be compressed using gzip etc so that the transmitted data size is much smaller. This speeds up the upload and download.

5. **Connection Pool**
When accessing resources, we often need to load data from the database. Opening the closing db connections add significant overhead. So we should connect to the db via a pool of open connections. The connection pool is responsible for managing the connection lifecycle.
