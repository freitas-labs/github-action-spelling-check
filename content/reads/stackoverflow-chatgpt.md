Back in December, Stack Overflow [“banned”](https://matt-rickard.com/stack-overflow-bans-chatgpt) the use of ChatGPT on its site. Fast forward a few months, Similar Web reported that Stack Overflow traffic was [down 14%](https://www.similarweb.com/amp/blog/insights/ai-news/stack-overflow-chatgpt/) in March 2023.

“Data is the new oil,” — but here we have a company with very little proprietary data (OpenAI) creating a model that powers a product that beats Stack Exchange, a company with a large amount of proprietary data. More than that, the Stack Exchange data seems perfectly fit for the RLHF layer over these models — they’ve been collecting human feedback for decades on answers. 

A few thoughts.

**They gave the data away for free.** Stack Exchange (the overarching brand covering Stack Overflow, Math Overflow, etc.) makes up 5.13% (64GB) of [The Pile](https://matt-rickard.com/laion-the-pile-and-more-datasets) — a dataset used to train many of the large language models. Stack Exchange has been publishing this data since 2014 ([archive](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange)). 

**Stack Exchange was already in decline.** The company has struggled to monetize its engaged user base for years, resulting in a sale to Prosus in 2021. Increasingly, question-answering and knowledge sharing happens in GitHub repositories around issues and pull requests.
