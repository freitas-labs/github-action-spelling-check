The following is not a read itself, but rather a diagram that illustrates "every" possible type of VPN, shared on LinkedIn. I quote "every", because as pointed in the post comments, it's missing some unique VPN protocols like [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) and [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/). Nevertheless, it's a good overview.
