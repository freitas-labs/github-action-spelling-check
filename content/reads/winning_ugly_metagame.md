Brad Gilbert is a former professional tennis player and Olympic gold medalist. He wrote a book about tennis strategy called _Winning Ugly: Mental Warfare in Tennis,_ where he detailed the somewhat unorthodox strategies he used against opponents he deemed much better than himself. While I don't know much about tennis, it stressed the importance of the metagame.
