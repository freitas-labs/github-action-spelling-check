On Patrick Collison’s (the co-founder and CEO of Stripe) personal site, he has a page for “Advice.” It provides some life advice for readers aged 10-20, but under the 20-30 section, he puts, “If you're 20–30: I don't know yet. I plan to think about this when I'm 35-40.” I call this the _Collison Principle of Advice_:

> Don't give advice until enough time has passed to gain proper perspective and understanding

So on the topic of “Reasons to Start a Startup,” I defer to the experts. I have my reasons, but I’ll have to wait a few years (at least) to dispense that advice. So here are Marc Andreessen, Paul Graham, and Elad Gil’s thoughts on the topic — startup veterans who have both started companies and met and evaluated thousands of startup founders.

Good reasons to do a startup (Marc Andreessen, [Why not to do a startup](https://fictivekin.github.io/pmarchive-jekyll/guide_to_startups_part1.html?ref=matt-rickard.ghost.io))

*   The opportunity to be in control of your own destiny
*   The opportunity to create something new
*   The chance to have an impact on the world
*   The ability to create your ideal culture and work with a dream team of people you get to assemble yourself.
*   Money

Reasons to not do a startup (Marc Andreessen, [Why not to do a startup](https://fictivekin.github.io/pmarchive-jekyll/guide_to_startups_part1.html?ref=matt-rickard.ghost.io))

*   Emotional rollercoaster
*   Nothing happens unless you make it happen
*   “Hiring is a huge pain in the ass.”
*   Time commitment
*   It’s really easy for a startup to go sideways

Forms of desperation that motivate founders to start companies (Elad Gil, [Startups are an act of desperation](https://blog.eladgil.com/p/startups-are-an-act-of-desperation?ref=matt-rickard.ghost.io)):

*   Career desperation — Allow people early or stuck in their careers to jump a few steps ahead
*   Financial desperation — Condense decades of salary into a shorter period
*   Product or mission desperation — Founders who want something to exist in the world
*   Desperation to do something big or important and to avoid wasted time — “make a dent in the universe.”
*   Revenge vs. the Arena — Founders who have something to prove

Bad reasons to avoid doing a startup (Paul Graham, [Why To Not Not Start a Startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html?ref=matt-rickard.ghost.io))

*   Too young
*   Too inexperienced
*   Not smart enough
*   Know nothing about business
*   No idea
*   No room for more startups
*   Don’t realize what you’re avoiding
*   Parents want you to be a doctor
*   A job is the default

Good reasons not to avoid doing a startup (Paul Graham, [Why To Not Not Start a Startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html?ref=matt-rickard.ghost.io))

*   Not determined enough
*   No cofounder
*   Family to support
*   Independently wealthy
*   Not ready for commitment (3-4 years minimum)
*   Need for structure
*   Fear of uncertainty
