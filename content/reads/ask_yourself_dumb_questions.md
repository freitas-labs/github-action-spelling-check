The author presents the idea of asking dumb questions, instead of focusing only on what seems right. Dumb and simple questions are an important factor of thinking process, as they allow us to conceptualize new paths and consequences that don't provide much value.

And answer them.

We often see products in their final form – a presentation, working code, or a published post. But the discovery process is often just as illuminating. Even the dead ends.

Asking dumb questions helps us speedrun those paths that didn't end up working out. Usually, you'll find out quickly why the default path is correct, but once in a while, you'll find a more surprising result.

Dumb questions also help us test our own understanding. What happens when a code block is removed? Could this function use a different class? Dumb questions can unlock a better understanding of the underlying structure.
